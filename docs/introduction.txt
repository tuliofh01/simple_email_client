1. SMTP FUNDAMENTALS (READ THIS ONCE, USE FOREVER)

Before touching any language, understand what SMTP actually is.

1.1 Core SMTP flow:
	* SMTP is a line-oriented TCP protocol (RFC 5321).
	Open TCP connection to server (usually port 25, 587, or 465)
		Server greets you (220)
		You identify yourself (EHLO)
		Optionally negotiate TLS (STARTTLS)
	Authenticate (AUTH)
	Send envelope:
		MAIL FROM
		RCPT TO
		DATA
			headers
			blank line
			body
			.\r\n
	Quit (QUIT)
	* You are exchanging plain text commands and responses.

1.2 What you must read
	RFC 5321 – SMTP
	RFC 5322 – email headers
	RFC 3207 – STARTTLS
	RFC 4954 – SMTP AUTH

1.3 Reality check
	* Modern servers require: 
		TLS, 
		Authentication, 
		Correct headers (From, To, Date, Message-ID)
	* If you ignore this, your email will vanish into spam purgatory.
